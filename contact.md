I'm a pretty social person so you can find me almost everywhere in the wild. Contact me, I commit to get back to you as soon as I am available and answer any questions you may have.

- I tweet a lot on front-end development stuff. More or less. 
- Sometimes I share pixels on Dribbble.
- There's a RTD page on Facebook, feel free to like it and get in touch to me. 
- I'm on GitHub too. Not so active as I'd like to be, but I try to do my best.
- On Instagram, I share random pictures I take with my phone.
- Not a big fan, still I have a LinkedIn account as well.
- Add me on Google+, say hello and let's be friends.

##Also, you should know that:

- Currently, I am not available for freelance projects.
- I do not publish guest posts here, unless perhaps you have a cool front-end technique you'd like to share.
