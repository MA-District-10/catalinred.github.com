Hello, my name is Catalin Rosu and I’m a web designer/developer. I'm that guy(geek?!) who loves to sit in front of his computer almost all the time. This is my personal website where I like to do stuff as writing tutorials and share front-end web development info.

I live in Craiova, Romania and currently work at <a href="http://www.caphyon.com/">Caphyon</a>. I have a computer science degree but most of my knowledge comes from reading, blogging, and learning from those I’ve worked with along the time.

When I'm not doing all of these, I play video games on my <del datetime="2011-11-28T19:02:45+00:00">PS3</del> Xbox 360 and hanging out with my friends.

<h3>Why Red?</h3>
Because Rosu (RO) = Red (EN). That's why most of my friends call me Red. Also, this explains my twitter handle too: <a href="https://twitter.com/catalinred">@catalinred</a>

<h3>Contact me</h3>
Do you have any questions? Feel free to <a href="/contact">say "Hi"</a>!
